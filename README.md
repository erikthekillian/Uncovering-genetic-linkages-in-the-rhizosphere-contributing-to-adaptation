# Uncovering genetic linkages in the rhizosphere contributing to adaptation


### Filter and cleaning reads
Each site-year was cleaned individually as shown in 20XX_filtering. 

### Merging into phyloseq object and analysis
The reads from each site-year were compiled into phyloseq objects which were then subsequentely compiled into one phyloseq object encompassing all site-years.
This phyloseq object was used in
